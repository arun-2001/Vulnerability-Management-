<h1>  Vulnerability-Management </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. You can use this lab for your resume to gain experience when applying to vulnerability management roles!

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b> VMWare Workstation Player </b> (21H2)
- <b>Windows 10 ISO </b> (21H2)
-  <b> Nessus Essentials</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<h2>Ensure Connectivity VM </h2>

<h6>1. *Network Configuration:* Ensure that the visual machine has the correct network configuration, including IP address settings, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers.

2. *Firewall Settings:* Check the firewall settings on the visual machine to allow incoming and outgoing connections as needed for your applications.

3. *Network Adapter:* Make sure that the network adapter of the visual machine is properly configured and enabled.

4. *Network Testing:* Perform network testing from the visual machine to verify connectivity. This can include pinging other devices on the network or accessing external websites.

5. *Virtual Machine Settings:* If the visual machine is a virtual machine, ensure that its virtual network settings are correctly configured in the virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox).

6. *Security Considerations:* Consider security aspects such as network segmentation, VLANs, and firewall rules to protect the visual machine and its network connections.</h6>

<h2> To Create a new scan in Nessus </h2>

<h6> 
1. LogIn: Open your Nessus web interface and log in with your credentials.

2. *Navigate to Scans:* Once logged in, go to the "Scans" tab. This is where you manage all your scans.

3. *Create New Scan:* Click on the "New Scan" button or a similar option depending on your Nessus version.

4. *Configure Scan Settings:*
   - *Scan Name:* Enter a descriptive name for your scan to easily identify it later.
   - *Targets:* Specify the target(s) you want to scan. This can be an IP address, range, hostname, or CIDR notation.
   - *Scan Policy:* Choose the scan policy that best suits your requirements. Nessus provides several built-in policies, or you can create custom ones.
   - *Schedule:* Set up a schedule for the scan if you want it to run regularly at specific intervals.
   - *Advanced Settings:* Optionally, configure advanced settings such as scan options, credentials for authenticated scanning, and plugins to include or exclude.

5. *Start the Scan:* Once you've configured the scan settings, click on the "Save" or "Start Scan" button to initiate the scan.

6. *Monitor Progress:* You can monitor the progress of your scan from the "Scans" tab. Nessus will display information such as scan status, completion percentage, and any issues detected.

7. *View Scan Results:* After the scan completes, you can view the detailed results by clicking on the scan name in the "Scans" tab. This will show you vulnerabilities, recommendations, and other findings.

8. *Take Action:* Based on the scan results, take appropriate actions to remediate vulnerabilities and improve the security posture of your systems.</h6>



<h2>To Inspect the Results of the First Scan in Nessus</h2>
<h6>

1. *LogIn:* Access the Nessus web interface and log in with your credentials.

2. *Navigate to Scans:* Go to the "Scans" tab, which lists all your scans, including the first scan you performed.

3. *Select Scan:* Locate the first scan you want to inspect from the list of scans. Click on its name to view detailed results.

4. *View Summary:* The scan summary provides an overview of the scan results, including the number of hosts scanned, vulnerabilities found, and severity levels.

5. *View Hosts:* Check the list of hosts that were scanned during the first scan. You can see details such as IP addresses, hostnames, and operating systems.

6. *View Vulnerabilities:* Click on the vulnerabilities section to see a detailed list of vulnerabilities detected during the scan. Nessus categorizes vulnerabilities based on severity levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

7. *Filter and Sort:* Use filters and sorting options to narrow down the list of vulnerabilities based on criteria such as severity, host, plugin ID, or vulnerability name.

8. *View Detailed Reports:* Nessus provides detailed reports for each vulnerability, including descriptions, risk ratings, affected hosts, and remediation recommendations.

9. *Take Action:* Review each vulnerability and prioritize remediation efforts based on severity and impact. You can also export reports or share findings with other team members for collaboration.

10. *Remediate Vulnerabilities:* Work with system administrators and security teams to address identified vulnerabilities by applying patches, configurations, or implementing security controls.

11. *Rescan if Needed:* If you've made changes or applied fixes, consider rescanning the hosts to verify that vulnerabilities have been remediated successfully.</h6>
